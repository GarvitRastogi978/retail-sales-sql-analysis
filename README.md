## Project Overview

**Project Title:** Retail Sales Analysis with SQL
**Difficulty Level:** Beginner
**Tools:** PostgreSQL
**Skills/Language:** SQL

This hands-on project showcases essential SQL techniques used by data analysts to investigate real-world retail sales data. You’ll walk through the full analytical workflow: from setting up a dedicated sales database to performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and extracting actionable business insights using targeted SQL queries. Perfect for SQL beginners, this project builds core data manipulation and analytical skills while solving practical business problems — making it an ideal foundation for your data analytics journey.

## Objectives

1. **Set up a retail sales database**: Create and populate a retail sales database with the provided sales data.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and remove any records with missing or null values.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
4. **Business Analysis**: Use SQL to answer specific business questions and derive insights from the sales data.

## Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup
- **Database Creation**: The project starts by creating a database named `p1_retail_db`.
- **Table Creation**: A table named `retail_sales` is created to store the sales data. The table structure includes columns for transaction ID, sale date, sale time, customer ID, gender, age, product category, quantity sold, price per unit, cost of goods sold (COGS), and total sale amount.
  
### 2. Data Exploration & Cleaning
- **Record Count**: Determine the total number of records in the dataset.
- **Customer Count**: Find out how many unique customers are in the dataset.
- **Category Count**: Identify all unique product categories in the dataset.
- **Null Value Check**: Check for any null values in the dataset and delete records with missing data.
  
### 3. Data Analysis & Findings

## Conclusion

This project serves as a comprehensive introduction to SQL for data analysts, covering database setup, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and business-driven SQL queries.
